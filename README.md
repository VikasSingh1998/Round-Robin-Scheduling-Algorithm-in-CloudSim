# Round Robin Task Scheduling on Cloudsim

In this repository I have implemented **round robin** task scheduling 
algorithm to assign cloudlets to VMs. To implement this I didn't make 
any changes to the **DatacenterBroker.java** class. I implemented this 
in the default method for printing the cloudlets.

## Simulator Used
* [Cloudsim](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim)
```
version: 3.0.3
```
